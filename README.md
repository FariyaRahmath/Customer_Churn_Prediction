# Customer Churn Prediction
Naan Mudhalvan Project
This is my 5th sem Naan Mudhalvan Project.
I used the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset from Kaggle.
This was a group project, but the code that I have uploaded is mine.
We were required to use IBM Cognos platform to perform visualizations.
The process of completing the project was divided into 5 phases..
In the 1st phase, I created an Introduction and Overview of our project.
In the 2nd phase, I preprocessed the dataset and converted the categorical values to numeric values.
In the 3rd phase, we performed the visualizations by using the IBM Cognos platform.
In the 4th phase, I created the dashboard and reports for the given dataset using the IBM Cognos platform.
In the 5th phase, I have included both my coding and the features of my project.
